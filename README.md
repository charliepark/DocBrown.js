# TomDoc.js

A probably-not-working-yet TomDoc parser for JavaScript files.

## What is this?

I've recently fallen in love with the [TomDoc](http://tomdoc.org/) documentation specification. At the moment, though, I'm having to generate and maintain a separate internal HTML file for recording the different functions, their parameters, their expected output, and so on. Seems like needless work, right? Ideally, this will create a simpler way of generating documentation, based off the TomDocs in my JS files.

**There's a very good chance this doesn't work.** I've never built a JS parser before, and this could get messy. But I'd like to learn. Let's see how this goes.
